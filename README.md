![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power%20BI-Specialist%20Project-blue) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green)

## üìã Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my capstone learning experience for the Power BI Specialist Certification. It focuses on building a **Car Sales Dashboard** for a car dealership to provide real-time, actionable insights into critical sales KPIs. The objective is to empower the sales team with data-driven decision-making capabilities and identify trends that can drive future growth.

## üöó Background & Problem Statement

### Background
The car dealership sells a variety of car models and needed a reliable tool to track and analyze their sales performance effectively. The Car Sales Dashboard was created to address this requirement by visualizing KPIs and presenting data insights that improve decision-making.

### Problem Statement
The dealership faced challenges in accessing consistent, real-time sales insights, which led to missed opportunities and ineffective strategies. The dashboard project was designed to:
1. **Provide Real-Time KPI Insights**: Track key metrics for better sales monitoring and planning.
2. **Enable Trend Analysis**: Identify trends across car models, body styles, regions, and colors.
3. **Enhance Decision-Making**: Offer reliable data for the sales team to make informed decisions.

## üõ† Solution: Car Sales Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard was developed with the following capabilities:

- **KPI Tracking**:
  - Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales
  - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Sales and Average Price
  - Sales Differences between YTD and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD)
  
- **Sales Metrics**:
  - Average Price Analysis (YTD and MTD)
  - Cars Sold Metrics, including YTD, MTD, and YOY Growth

- **Sales Visualizations**:
  - **YTD Sales Weekly Trend**: Line chart showing weekly YTD sales.
  - **YTD Sales by Body Style and Color**: Pie charts representing sales distribution by car body style and color.
  - **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region**: Map visualization for regional sales insights.
  - **Company-Wise Sales Trend**: Grid displaying each company‚Äôs YTD sales.
  - **Details Grid**: A comprehensive table with details on car model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and more.

## üîç Visualizations Used

The dashboard utilizes several visualizations to present insights effectively:
- **Table** and **Matrix** for detailed data views
- **Stacked Area Chart** for historical sales trends
- **Pie Charts** for distribution of sales by car color and body style
- **Map Visualization** for geographic sales analysis
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to track real-time metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

This project was built using the following tools and technologies:
- **Power BI** for dashboard development and visualization
- **Power Query** for data transformation
- **DAX** for creating custom calculations and measures
- **Power BI Service** for online sharing and updates
- **Gateway** for real-time data refresh
- **Excel** for initial data support and ETL processes

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and transformed sales data using Power Query.
2. **KPI Development**: Created DAX calculations to track YTD, MTD, and YOY metrics.
3. **Visualization Design**: Developed a series of interactive charts and tables to present the data insights.
4. **Dashboard Publishing**: Published the dashboard on Power BI Service and set up a data gateway for real-time updates.

## üí° Key Insights

The Car Sales Dashboard provides valuable insights for the dealership team, such as:
- Trends in YTD and MTD sales growth across car models and regions
- Identification of top-selling car body styles and colors
