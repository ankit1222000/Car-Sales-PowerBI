# Car-Sales-PowerBI

I have designed and developed an interactive Car Sales Dashboard for a car dealership, helping to drive insights into sales performance and support data-driven decisions.

🚗 Project Overview:
The dealership faced a need for consistent, real-time insights into sales performance. My solution was a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes essential KPIs to monitor sales progress, understand trends, and uncover growth opportunities.

🛠 Project Approach:
Defined KPIs: Tracked metrics like Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth, and differences in sales compared to previous periods.
Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed sales data for accuracy, using Power Query and DAX for calculations.
Visualization of Key Insights: Created charts and grids to represent trends and metrics across car body styles, colors, dealer regions, and more.
🔍 Dashboard Features:
Sales Overview: Line and Pie Charts for trends, including YTD Sales by Body Style and Color.
Dealer Region Analysis: Map visualization of YTD Cars Sold by dealer region.
Detailed Grids: Grids displaying all car sales data by model, body style, color, and sales figures for comprehensive insights.
🔧 Technologies Used:
Power BI, Power Query, Power BI Service, and Gateway for data visualization
DAX measures and calculated columns for custom metrics
Excel for initial data support and validation
🎉 Outcome: This dashboard empowers the dealership team to make informed decisions with real-time data insights, boosting sales strategies and performance tracking.
